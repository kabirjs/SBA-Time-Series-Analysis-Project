## Abstract
This paper presents a time series analysis of monthly passenger counts through Santa Barbara Municipal
Airport. The data was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Two forecasting models were
used: a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and a Lagged Regression
model.

The SARIMA model is a widely used method for forecasting time series data that exhibits seasonality. It is
an extension of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model that includes seasonal terms.
The Lagged Regression model, on the other hand, is a linear regression model that uses lagged values of the
dependent variable as predictors.

In this study, both models were fit to the data and their forecasting performance was evaluated. The
results show that both models were able to accurately forecast passenger counts, with the SARIMA model
performing slightly better. Further research is needed to determine the optimal model parameters and to
evaluate the performance of these models on other datasets.
In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of both SARIMA and Lagged Regression models for
forecasting passenger counts through Santa Barbara Municipal Airport. These models can provide valuable
insights for airport management and planning.
